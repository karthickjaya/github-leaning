div vs section:
section has some similar set of elements
whereas in div that is not the case
it can have differe set of elements
<div>this is div</div>
<section>this is section</section>
<artcle>this is article</artcle>

what is css:
cascaded style sheet
types of css:
1.inline
2.internal
3.external

All the properties of css can be in terms of key=value pair

inline css can be applied inside the tag itself using the style attribute

Internal Css:
it can be applied  by using the <style></style> tag
selectors:
class,id,tag
class selectors:
syntax:
.classname{

}
class selector can be applied for more than 1 elements

Id selector:
syntax:
#idname{

}
idname is applicable only for the one element
it is refered using id attribute
1.for a single element can i apply class as well as id  attribute??
2.if yes is about answer then which color will render
priorites:
Inline>id>class
id selecto will be having the highest priority
compared to id,inline css will be having highest priority
External css:
To connect external css we need link tag
<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
here rel stands for relation between documents
href stands for the link where file exists
inline>internal>external
